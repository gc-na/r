# computeRestarts: Efficiently Handling Restarts in R

## Synopsis
The `computeRestarts` function in R is designed to facilitate the management of restart points in long-running computations, particularly in contexts where error handling is critical.

## Documentation

### Purpose
`computeRestarts` is used to define and manage restart points in R, allowing users to recover from errors and continue computations from predefined states. This feature is especially useful in complex workflows where interruptions can occur, enabling a more robust and fault-tolerant programming approach.

### Usage
```R
computeRestarts(expr, ...)
```

### Arguments
- `expr`: An expression that represents the computation you wish to run.
- `...`: Additional parameters that may be specified to customize the behavior of the restarts.

### Details
- **Restarts** are points in a computation that allow the user to resume execution from a specified state after encountering an error.
- The function is often used in conjunction with error handlers to define what should happen when a specific error occurs.
- This is particularly beneficial in scenarios involving iterative processes, simulations, or any long-running tasks where maintaining state is crucial.

## Examples

### Basic Example
```R
# Define a restart for a simple computation
restart_example <- function() {
  tryCatch({
    # Simulate an error
    stop("An error occurred")
  }, error = function(e) {
    # Handle the error and provide a restart option
    computeRestarts({
      message("Error handled. Restarting computation.")
      # Code to resume or restart process
    })
  })
}

# Run the example function
restart_example()
```

### Example with Iteration
```R
# A function that may encounter errors during iteration
iterative_process <- function(n) {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    if (i == 3) {
      stop("Error at iteration 3")
    }
    print(i)
  }
}

# Using computeRestarts to handle errors
tryCatch({
  iterative_process(5)
}, error = function(e) {
  computeRestarts({
    message("Restarting from iteration after error.")
    # Code to resume from iteration 4
    for (j in 4:5) {
      print(j)
    }
  })
})
```

## Explanation
- **Common Pitfalls**: One of the most frequent mistakes when using `computeRestarts` is failing to properly define the restart points, which can lead to incomplete or incorrect state restoration.
- **Gotchas**: Users might overlook the need to ensure that the context in which the restart occurs has access to all necessary variables and states, which can lead to runtime errors.
- **Additional Notes**: It is important to test the behavior of restarts thoroughly, especially in complex applications where multiple errors could potentially occur at different stages.

## One Line Summary
`computeRestarts` in R allows users to manage and recover from errors in long-running computations by defining restart points for execution.
