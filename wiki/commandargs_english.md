# commandArgs in R: Accessing Command Line Arguments

## Synopsis
`commandArgs` is a function in R that allows users to retrieve command line arguments passed to an R script. This feature is particularly useful for creating scripts that can accept user-defined parameters at runtime, enhancing the flexibility and usability of R programs.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `commandArgs` function is designed to facilitate the retrieval of arguments that are passed when invoking an R script from the command line. This capability is essential for creating dynamic scripts that perform different actions based on user input.

### Usage
```R
commandArgs(trailingOnly = FALSE)
```

#### Arguments
- `trailingOnly`: A logical value. If set to `TRUE`, the function will only return the arguments after the script name, ignoring the arguments that pertain to the R interpreter itself. The default value is `FALSE`.

### Details
When an R script is executed from the command line, it can receive various parameters. The `commandArgs` function captures these parameters, which can then be used within the script to modify behavior or output. This is particularly useful for batch processing, automated scripts, or any situation where user input is required.

## Examples
1. **Basic Usage**:
   To retrieve all command line arguments, including the script name:
   ```R
   args <- commandArgs()
   print(args)
   ```

2. **Using trailingOnly**:
   To get only the parameters passed after the script name:
   ```R
   args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
   print(args)
   ```

3. **Example Script**:
   Save the following script as `example.R`:
   ```R
   args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)
   if (length(args) == 0) {
       stop("No arguments provided. Please provide input.")
   }
   print(paste("You provided:", args))
   ```
   Run the script from the command line:
   ```bash
   Rscript example.R arg1 arg2
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   [1] "You provided: arg1 arg2"
   ```

## Explanation
While using `commandArgs`, users should be aware of several common pitfalls:
- **Argument Misinterpretation**: If arguments contain spaces, they should be enclosed in quotes when passed from the command line.
- **Default Behavior**: By default, `commandArgs` returns both the R interpreter arguments and the script arguments unless `trailingOnly` is set to `TRUE`. This may lead to confusion if users expect to retrieve only their input.
- **Error Handling**: It's good practice to check if any arguments were passed to avoid runtime errors and to provide user-friendly messages.

## One Line Summary
`commandArgs` is a powerful R function for accessing command line arguments, enabling dynamic script behavior based on user input.
