# [Unix] C Shell (csh) else: Conditional execution in scripts

## Overview
The `else` command in C Shell (csh) is used as part of conditional statements to execute a block of code when the preceding `if` condition evaluates to false. It allows for more complex decision-making in scripts by providing an alternative path of execution.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `else` command is as follows:

```csh
if (condition) then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if condition is false
endif
```

## Common Options
The `else` command itself does not have options, but it is typically used in conjunction with the `if` statement. The options for the `if` statement can include various conditions that determine the flow of execution.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Simple if-else
```csh
set var = 10
if ($var > 5) then
    echo "Variable is greater than 5"
else
    echo "Variable is 5 or less"
endif
```

### Example 2: Checking for a file
```csh
set filename = "example.txt"
if (-e $filename) then
    echo "File exists"
else
    echo "File does not exist"
endif
```

### Example 3: User input validation
```csh
set user_input = $1
if ("$user_input" == "yes") then
    echo "You agreed!"
else
    echo "You did not agree."
endif
```

## Tips
- Always ensure that the `endif` statement is included to properly close the `if` block.
- Use parentheses around conditions for clarity and to avoid syntax errors.
- Combine `else` with `else if` for multiple conditional checks to create more complex logic flows.
