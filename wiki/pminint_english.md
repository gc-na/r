# pmin.int: Efficiently Finding Minimum Values in R

## Synopsis
`pmin.int` is a specialized function in R that computes the parallel minimum of integer vectors, returning the smallest values across vectors element-wise. 

## Documentation

### Purpose
The primary purpose of `pmin.int` is to provide an efficient way to determine the minimum values from multiple integer vectors in a parallel manner. This function is particularly useful when working with large datasets where performance is critical.

### Usage
```R
pmin.int(..., na.rm = FALSE)
```

### Arguments
- `...`: One or more integer vectors. All vectors must be of the same length or be recycled to the length of the longest vector.
- `na.rm`: A logical value indicating whether to remove `NA` values. If set to `TRUE`, `NA` values are ignored in the computation of the minimum.

### Details
The `pmin.int` function is optimized for integer operations and is part of the base package in R. It is designed to handle multiple vectors efficiently, making it suitable for applications in data analysis and statistics.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```R
# Define integer vectors
vec1 <- c(1L, 4L, 3L)
vec2 <- c(2L, 1L, 5L)

# Using pmin.int to find element-wise minimum
result <- pmin.int(vec1, vec2)
print(result)  # Output: [1] 1 1 3
```

### Usage with NA Values
```R
# Define integer vectors with NA
vec3 <- c(3L, NA, 5L)
vec4 <- c(2L, 2L, NA)

# Finding minimum while ignoring NA values
result_na <- pmin.int(vec3, vec4, na.rm = TRUE)
print(result_na)  # Output: [1] 2 2 5
```

## Explanation
When using `pmin.int`, it's essential to ensure that the vectors being compared are of compatible lengths. If the vectors have different lengths, R will recycle the shorter vector. However, this can lead to unexpected results if not carefully managed.

A common pitfall is forgetting to set the `na.rm` argument when `NA` values are present, which may lead to an output that is also `NA` if any of the corresponding elements are `NA`. Always consider if you need to remove `NA` values before performing the operation.

## One Line Summary
`pmin.int` is an R function that efficiently computes the element-wise minimum of multiple integer vectors, with an option to handle `NA` values.
