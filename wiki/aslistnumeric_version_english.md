# as.list.numeric_version: Converting Numeric Versions to Lists in R

## Synopsis
The `as.list.numeric_version` function in R is designed to convert objects of class `numeric_version` into a list format, enabling easier manipulation and access to version components.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The primary purpose of `as.list.numeric_version` is to transform `numeric_version` objects, which represent software version numbers, into a list structure. This conversion is particularly useful for users who need to extract individual version components for comparison or further processing.

### Usage
```R
as.list(x)
```

### Arguments
- **x**: An object of class `numeric_version`. This should be a version number that you want to convert into a list.

### Details
Objects of class `numeric_version` are typically created using the `numeric_version()` function, which allows for the representation of software versions in a standardized way. The `as.list.numeric_version` function breaks down the version into its individual components (major, minor, patch, etc.) and returns them as a list.

## Examples
Here are some basic examples demonstrating the usage of `as.list.numeric_version`:

```R
# Creating a numeric_version object
version_obj <- numeric_version("1.2.3")

# Converting the numeric_version object to a list
version_list <- as.list(version_obj)

# Display the resulting list
print(version_list)
# Output: [[1]] 1
#         [[2]] 2
#         [[3]] 3
```

In this example, the version "1.2.3" is converted into a list containing the elements 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to the major, minor, and patch versions, respectively.

## Explanation
When using `as.list.numeric_version`, users should be aware of the following points:

- **Class Requirement**: The input must be of class `numeric_version`. Attempting to use this function on non-`numeric_version` objects will result in an error.
- **List Structure**: The output is a simple list where each element corresponds to a component of the version number. The first element is the major version, the second is the minor version, and the third is the patch version.
- **Version Formatting**: Ensure that the version string is correctly formatted when creating a `numeric_version` object. Improper formatting may lead to unexpected results or errors.

## One Line Summary
The `as.list.numeric_version` function in R converts a `numeric_version` object into a list format, providing easy access to individual version components.
