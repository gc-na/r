# Autoloader in R: Streamlining Package Management and Data Loading

## Synopsis
The `autoloader` is a feature in R that simplifies the process of loading packages and datasets automatically, enhancing workflow efficiency for R users by reducing manual steps in script execution.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `autoloader` function is designed to streamline the loading of R packages and datasets by automatically detecting and loading them as needed. This functionality is particularly useful in large projects where multiple packages and datasets are frequently used.

### Usage
To use the `autoloader`, you typically need to install the `autoloader` package first (if not already installed). Then, you can initiate the autoloader with the necessary configurations.

```R
install.packages("autoloader")  # Install the package
library(autoloader)              # Load the package

# Basic usage
autoloader::load("dplyr")        # Automatically loads the dplyr package
autoloader::load("my_data.csv")  # Automatically loads the specified dataset
```

### Details
- The `autoloader` function detects whether a package is installed and loads it if not already loaded.
- It can handle various types of files, including `.csv`, `.RData`, and other supported formats.
- The function can be configured to load multiple packages and datasets at once, resulting in a more efficient scripting process.

## Examples
```R
# Load the dplyr package
autoloader::load("dplyr")

# Load a dataset from a CSV file
autoloader::load("my_data.csv")

# Load multiple packages together
packages <- c("ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr")
autoloader::load(packages)

# Load multiple datasets
datasets <- c("data1.csv", "data2.csv")
autoloader::load(datasets)
```

## Explanation
While the `autoloader` significantly streamlines the loading process, users should be aware of the following common pitfalls:
- **Missing Packages**: If a package is not installed, the autoloader will throw an error. Ensure all required packages are installed before running your script.
- **File Paths**: When loading datasets, ensure the file paths are correct. Relative paths can lead to errors if the working directory is not set appropriately.
- **Conflicts**: Loading multiple packages that contain functions with the same name can lead to conflicts. It's best to explicitly specify which package's function you wish to use (e.g., `dplyr::filter()`).

## One Line Summary
The `autoloader` in R automates the loading of packages and datasets, streamlining the workflow for R users.
