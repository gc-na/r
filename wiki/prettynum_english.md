# prettyNum in R: Formatting Numbers for Readability

## Synopsis
The `prettyNum` function in R is designed to format numeric values into more readable text representations, allowing for enhanced presentation of numerical data in reports and visualizations.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`prettyNum` is used to convert numeric values into formatted strings that are easier for humans to read. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or when needing to present results in a clear and concise manner.

### Usage
```R
prettyNum(x, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE, preserve.width = "common", ...)
```

### Arguments
- `x`: A numeric vector to be formatted.
- `big.mark`: A character string to use for separating groups of thousands (default is a comma `,`).
- `scientific`: A logical value indicating whether to use scientific notation. If set to `TRUE`, the function converts numbers into scientific format.
- `preserve.width`: This argument decides how to deal with width preservation. The default is "common," which ensures that all formatted numbers have a consistent width.
- `...`: Additional arguments for future extensions.

### Details
The `prettyNum` function provides a flexible way to format numeric values. By customizing the `big.mark`, users can adapt the output to match regional formatting styles. The ability to switch between standard and scientific notation also makes this function versatile for different types of data presentations.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
```R
# Basic formatting of a numeric vector
numbers <- c(1000, 2500000, 1000000000)
formatted_numbers <- prettyNum(numbers)
print(formatted_numbers)
```

### Custom Big Mark
```R
# Using a different big mark
formatted_numbers_custom <- prettyNum(numbers, big.mark = ".")
print(formatted_numbers_custom)
```

### Scientific Notation
```R
# Formatting in scientific notation
formatted_scientific <- prettyNum(c(0.001, 0.00000025), scientific = TRUE)
print(formatted_scientific)
```

## Explanation
Common pitfalls when using `prettyNum` include:
- Forgetting to set `big.mark` appropriately for local formatting, which can lead to confusion in international datasets.
- Misunderstanding the `scientific` argument, which may result in unexpected output if you're unaccustomed to scientific notation.
- Not being aware that `prettyNum` outputs a character vector, which may require additional conversion if further numerical manipulation is needed.

Always ensure to validate the output format, especially when preparing data for analysis or reporting.

## One Line Summary
The `prettyNum` function in R is used to format numeric values into easily readable strings, enhancing the presentation of numerical data.
