# [Linux] C Shell (csh) true 用法等价: Always returns a successful exit status

## Overview
The `true` command in the C Shell (csh) is a simple utility that does nothing and always returns a successful exit status (0). It is often used in scripts and command sequences where a command is required syntactically, but no action is needed.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `true` command is straightforward:

```
true [options] [arguments]
```

However, `true` does not take any options or arguments.

## Common Options
The `true` command does not have any options or arguments. Its primary function is to return a success status.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage
Simply invoking `true` will return a success status.
```csh
true
```

### Example 2: Using in Conditional Statements
You can use `true` in conditional statements to create a loop that runs indefinitely.
```csh
while (1)
    true
end
```

### Example 3: Placeholder in Scripts
`true` can be used as a placeholder in scripts where a command is required but no action is needed.
```csh
if (some_condition) then
    true
else
    echo "Condition not met."
endif
```

### Example 4: Combining with Other Commands
You can use `true` to ensure that a command sequence continues even if a previous command fails.
```csh
command1 || true
command2
```

## Tips
- Use `true` as a placeholder in scripts to maintain syntax without performing any action.
- It can be helpful in loops or conditional statements where you want to ensure the flow continues without interruption.
- Remember that `true` always returns a success status, making it useful for testing or debugging scripts.
