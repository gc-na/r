# closeAllConnections: Efficiently Manage Connections in R

## Synopsis
`closeAllConnections` is an R function used to close all open connections, ensuring that resources are freed and potential data corruption is avoided during the execution of R scripts.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `closeAllConnections` function is designed to close all connections that have been opened in an R session. This is particularly useful in managing file connections, database connections, or network connections that may remain open unintentionally, leading to resource leaks or uncommitted data.

### Usage
```R
closeAllConnections()
```

### Details
- **Functionality**: When invoked, `closeAllConnections` checks for all types of open connections in the current R session and closes them. This includes connections to files, sockets, and databases.
- **Return Value**: The function does not return any value but performs the action of closing open connections.
- **Safety**: This function should be used judiciously, as closing connections unexpectedly can lead to loss of unsaved data.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
1. **Open a connection and then close it**:
   ```R
   # Open a connection to a text file
   con <- file("example.txt", "w")
   writeLines("Hello, World!", con)
   close(con)  # Close the individual connection

   # Alternatively, close all connections
   closeAllConnections()
   ```

2. **Check and close multiple connections**:
   ```R
   # Open multiple connections
   con1 <- file("file1.txt", "w")
   con2 <- file("file2.txt", "w")

   # Close all open connections
   closeAllConnections()
   ```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Uncommitted Data**: If you have unsaved data in an open connection (such as data being written to a file), invoking `closeAllConnections` will result in data loss. Always ensure that you commit or save your data before closing connections.
- **Debugging**: Closing connections can sometimes make debugging difficult if you inadvertently close a connection needed later in your script. Use specific connection closure when possible.
- **Non-Interactive Sessions**: In non-interactive sessions, itâ€™s good practice to clean up all connections to avoid memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

### Additional Notes
- It is advisable to monitor open connections during long-running scripts, as many R functions create temporary connections.
- `closeAllConnections` is particularly useful in R scripts that are run repeatedly, ensuring that you start with a clean state each time.

## One Line Summary
`closeAllConnections` is an R function that closes all open connections in the current session, helping to manage resources effectively.
