# Understanding `isRestart` in R: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `isRestart` function in R is used to determine if a given object is a restart object, which is relevant in the context of R's error handling and recovery mechanisms within the `tryCatch` framework.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `isRestart` function is designed to check if a specific object is a restart object. Restart objects are created when using the `withRestarts` function to define points in the execution flow where a user can recover from errors.

### Usage
```R
isRestart(x)
```

### Arguments
- `x`: An object that you want to test for being a restart object.

### Details
The `isRestart` function returns a logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). It plays a crucial role in error handling by helping users determine if they are dealing with a restart object, which can then be used in conjunction with the `doRestart` function to manage program flow during error conditions.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
Here are some examples demonstrating how to use `isRestart`:

1. **Basic Check**:
   ```R
   restart_example <- withRestarts(
     {
       stop("An error occurred")
     },
     restart_here = function() "Restarted!"
   )

   # Checking if the object is a restart
   isRestart(restart_example)  # This will return FALSE
   ```

2. **Using withRestarts**:
   ```R
   result <- withRestarts({
     stop("An error happened")
   }, restart_here = function() "Restarted successfully!")

   # Create a restart object
   restart_obj <- doRestart("restart_here")

   # Check if it is a restart
   isRestart(restart_obj)  # This will return TRUE
   ```

## Explanation
Using `isRestart` can be critical when implementing custom error handling in R applications. A common pitfall is misunderstanding the context in which restart objects are created and used. It is important to only check objects that are expected to be restart objects, as passing other object types will always return `FALSE`.

### Common Gotchas
- **Not All Errors Are Restartable**: Only errors that occur within the `withRestarts` context can create restart objects. If an error occurs outside this context, it cannot be restarted.
- **Misinterpreting Returns**: Always ensure you are verifying the right objects. Many functions can return complex structures, and it's essential to isolate the restart objects correctly.

## One Line Summary
`isRestart` is an R function that checks if a given object is a restart object used in error handling with `tryCatch` and `withRestarts`.
