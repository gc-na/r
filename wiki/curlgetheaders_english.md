# curlGetHeaders: Fetching HTTP Header Information in R

## Synopsis
`curlGetHeaders` is a function in R that retrieves the HTTP response headers for a specified URL, providing insights into the server's response and facilitating web scraping and API interaction.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `curlGetHeaders` function is designed for users who need to access the HTTP headers from a web server response. This can be particularly useful in web scraping, API exploration, and debugging.

### Usage
The function is part of the `curl` package in R and can be used as follows:

```R
curlGetHeaders(url)
```

### Parameters
- **url**: A character string containing the URL from which to retrieve the headers.

### Details
- The `curlGetHeaders` function sends a HEAD request to the specified URL, allowing it to fetch headers without downloading the entire body of the response.
- This function can be particularly beneficial for checking content types, authentication requirements, and caching policies.
- The headers returned are often in the form of a named list, making them easy to access and manipulate.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
To retrieve the headers of a webpage, you can use the following example:

```R
# Load the required package
library(curl)

# Fetch headers from a specific URL
headers <- curlGetHeaders("https://www.example.com")

# Print retrieved headers
print(headers)
```

### Checking Content Type
You can easily check the content type of a response using the retrieved headers:

```R
# Load the curl package
library(curl)

# Retrieve headers
headers <- curlGetHeaders("https://www.example.com")

# Check the content type
content_type <- headers[["Content-Type"]]
print(content_type)
```

## Explanation
While `curlGetHeaders` is straightforward to use, there are some common pitfalls:
- **Incorrect URLs**: Always ensure the URL is valid. If the URL is incorrect, the function may return an error or no headers.
- **Network Issues**: Network connectivity problems can prevent the function from retrieving headers. Ensure that your R session has internet access.
- **Response Codes**: The function will return headers even for non-200 response codes. Users should check the status codes to understand the context of the retrieved headers.

## One Line Summary
`curlGetHeaders` in R fetches HTTP response headers from a specified URL, aiding in web scraping and API interactions.
