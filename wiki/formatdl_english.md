## Documentation
### Purpose
The `formatDL` function is designed to generate clickable download links, enhancing the user experience when sharing files within R-based applications. It is particularly useful in Shiny apps or R Markdown documents, enabling easy access to datasets or reports.

### Usage
```R
formatDL(file, label = NULL, icon = NULL, class = NULL, ...)
```

### Parameters
- **file**: A character string specifying the URL or path to the file that is to be downloaded.
- **label**: An optional character string that defines the text to be displayed for the download link. If not provided, the filename will be used.
- **icon**: An optional character string specifying an icon to be displayed alongside the link, enhancing visual appeal.
- **class**: An optional character string allowing for additional CSS classes to be applied to the link for styling.
- **...**: Additional arguments that can be passed to control the link's behavior or appearance.

### Details
The `formatDL` function simplifies the process of creating user-friendly download links. The generated links can be styled with CSS to fit the design of the application or document. This function is particularly valuable for R developers who want to ensure that users can easily access downloadable content without cumbersome navigation.

## Examples
Here are a few basic examples demonstrating how to use the `formatDL` function:

### Example 1: Basic Download Link
```R
download_link <- formatDL("https://example.com/data.csv")
print(download_link)
```

### Example 2: Custom Label
```R
download_link <- formatDL("https://example.com/data.csv", label = "Download CSV Data")
print(download_link)
```

### Example 3: Adding an Icon
```R
download_link <- formatDL("https://example.com/data.csv", label = "Download CSV", icon = "download")
print(download_link)
```

### Example 4: Custom CSS Class
```R
download_link <- formatDL("https://example.com/data.csv", label = "Download CSV", class = "btn btn-primary")

## Explanation
When utilizing `formatDL`, users should be aware of a few common pitfalls:
- **URL Accessibility**: Ensure that the file path or URL is accessible; otherwise, the link will not work.
- **CSS Classes**: If custom CSS classes are applied, verify that the styles are defined in the application to avoid styling issues.
- **Icon Availability**: Icons may require specific font libraries (like Font Awesome) to be included in the project for proper display.
