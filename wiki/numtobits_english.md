# numToBits: Convert Numeric Values to Binary Representation in R

## Synopsis
The `numToBits` function in R is a utility that converts numeric values into their binary representation, enabling an easy visualization of how numbers are stored in binary format.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `numToBits` function is designed to provide a straightforward way to express numeric values as binary strings. This is particularly useful for understanding data representation in computer systems, debugging, and performing low-level data manipulations.

### Usage
The function is utilized in the following manner:

```R
numToBits(x)
```

#### Arguments
- `x`: A numeric vector (integer or double) that you wish to convert to binary representation.

### Details
- The function returns a raw vector containing the binary representation of the input number(s).
- Each number is represented as a sequence of bits, where each bit can either be `0` or `1`.
- The output can be useful for advanced programming tasks, such as bitwise operations, cryptography, or understanding machine-level representations of data.

## Examples
Here are some basic usage examples of the `numToBits` function:

```R
# Convert a single integer to binary
binary_representation <- numToBits(5)
print(binary_representation)
# Output: [1]  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0

# Convert a negative integer to binary
negative_binary <- numToBits(-5)
print(negative_binary)
# Output may vary based on internal representation

# Convert a double to binary
double_binary <- numToBits(2.5)
print(double_binary)
# Output: A raw vector representing the binary form of 2.5
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Negative Numbers**: When converting negative numbers, the output may not be intuitive as it uses two's complement representation. Therefore, understanding how negative values are represented in binary is essential.
- **Floating-Point Representation**: The binary representation of decimal numbers (like 2.5) can be more complex due to how floating-point arithmetic is handled in computers. This may lead to unexpected results if users are unfamiliar with IEEE 754 standards.

### Additional Notes
- The output is a raw vector, which may require conversion to a more readable format for display purposes.
- The length of the raw vector will depend on the architecture of the system (32-bit or 64-bit), affecting how many bits are represented.

## One Line Summary
The `numToBits` function in R converts numeric values to their binary representation, facilitating understanding of how numbers are stored in computer systems.
