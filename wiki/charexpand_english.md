# char.expand: A Comprehensive Guide to Character Expansion in R

## Synopsis
`char.expand` is a function in R that enables users to expand character vectors into a specified length, filling with a specified character if needed. It is particularly useful for formatting and ensuring uniformity in character data structures.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `char.expand` function is to standardize the length of character vectors. It allows for the expansion of each element in a character vector to a predetermined length, making it easier to manage and analyze data with varying string lengths.

### Usage
The function can be used as follows:

```R
char.expand(x, width, fill = " ")
```

### Parameters
- **x**: A character vector that you want to expand.
- **width**: An integer specifying the desired length of each character element after expansion.
- **fill**: A character used to fill the additional space if the original character is shorter than the specified width. The default value is a space (`" "`).

### Details
The `char.expand` function is particularly useful when preparing data for display or analysis where uniformity in string length is required. This can be exceptionally valuable in generating reports or aligning output in console applications.

## Examples
Here are basic usage examples of the `char.expand` function:

```R
# Example 1: Expanding a simple character vector
char_vector <- c("R", "is", "awesome")
expanded_vector <- char.expand(char_vector, width = 10)
print(expanded_vector)
# Output: [1] "R        " "is       " "awesome   "

# Example 2: Using a different fill character
expanded_vector_custom_fill <- char.expand(char_vector, width = 10, fill = "-")
print(expanded_vector_custom_fill)
# Output: [1] "R--------" "is-------" "awesome--"
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Non-character Inputs**: Ensure that the input is a character vector. Passing other data types (like numeric or lists) will result in an error.
2. **Width Parameter**: Setting the width parameter to a value less than the length of the longest string in the vector will not truncate the strings; instead, the original strings will remain unchanged.
3. **Fill Character Length**: The fill character should ideally be a single character. Using multi-character strings may result in unexpected behavior, as only the first character will be used for filling.

### Gotchas
- When using `char.expand`, be mindful of the fill character; if it is not a single character, the output may not meet your formatting needs.
- The function does not modify the original vector; it returns a new one with the specified formatting.

## One Line Summary
`char.expand` is an R function that standardizes the length of character vectors by expanding them with a specified fill character.
